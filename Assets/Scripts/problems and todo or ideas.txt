-Game.Transition logic needs to be broken out into tick, latetick and undo actions
-objects should store their own stack of states, and pop when the undo action is called

-player and leveldie share die code
-make generic class -> that they will both have an instance of 

-player undo logic in game should be moved to player

[[[[[[]]]]]] Entities are not getting moved in the entity array on undo

Ideas seen in other games:
Slippery/sliding
changing die faces to different values
rotation blocks

original ideas:
Leveldie that has mirrored movement on the grid from playerdie, allow mirroring across each axis
gate shaped like this ト　
spawner that spawns something after x ticks
gate that gets destroyed after x ticks
